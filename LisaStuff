you want to rais the max freq:
<configure name="TELEMETRY_FREQUENCY" value="100"/>
[15:12:45] Felix Ruess: the function that sends telemetry messages runs at TELEMETRY_FREQUENCY, so that max is for all messages...
[15:13:04] Felix Ruess: but how often each message is sent is defined by the period in your telemetry.xml file
[15:13:25] Jonas Van Pelt: ok
[15:13:53] Felix Ruess: also your PERIODIC_FREQUENCY needs to be >= TELEMETRY_FREQUENCY
[15:14:01] Jonas Van Pelt: okay
[15:14:19] Felix Ruess: which is already the case for rotorcraft firmware, where it defaults to 512Hz
